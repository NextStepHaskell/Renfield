==========

Renfield is a "press your luck" game largely ripping off, I mean inspired by the game "Zombie Dice".

Game Rules

Characters are vampires controlling a ghoul (a renfield of sorts).
Your renfield's job is to collect more victims to make into ghouls.

The game is divided into two phases. In phase one a player's turn looks like this.
